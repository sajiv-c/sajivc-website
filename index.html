    <h1>Welcome to Sajiv's Website!</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <p>First off, thank you for visiting my website! My name is Sajiv Chandrasekaran, and I am a recent graduate from the wonderful University of Miami, where I studied biology and computer science. I fell in love with medicine as a child, and strongly wanted to pursue a career in the field, going so far as completing a Pre-Med track in high school focused on biological and anatomical classes. However, come sophomore year of college, I unfortunately found myself falling out of love with the one thing I had convinced myself I wanted to pursue: a career in medicine. Now, there were a lot of factors that fueled this revelation, but the main one was the fact that I just didn't enjoy what I was studying anymore; the long hours of memorizing monotonous and repetitive material had finally taken their toll on me. I don't say this to put down the medical field in any way, but rather to justify my following decision: I shifted my academic and personal focus towards the domain of programming and computer science. This may seem strange, going from biology to coding, but I had also been intrigued by software development for a while, stemming from an introductory comp sci lecture in high school. As a child, I'd loved playing with Legos and solving puzzles and riddles, and to a more mature mind, software development offers the same interactivity and joy. Think about it: building an HTML website in blocks = building Lego sets, debugging and finally fixing a JavaScript program = solving a Sudoko table, etc. So, after weighing my options, I decided to pursue an education and subsequent career within the field of software development. It's going wonderfully, and in fact, this website is a direct result of my progress so far; there's still a long and difficult road ahead, but I can't wait for what's next!</p>

    <h2>My programming journey:</h2>
    <p>As I said, my passion for computer science first emerged in high school, during that introductory lecture; however, I didn't really start to get into it until the end of sophomore year in college, which was when I decided to change my academic focus from biology to computer science. Now, I didn't have enough time to completely switch my major, so I graduated with a major in Biology and a minor in Computer Science. Regardless, the classes I completed provided me with the foundational knowledge I needed to progress through my journey. They introduced me to data structures, system architecture concepts, the command terminal, and even exposed me to languages such as Java, C, and R (purely for statistical purposes). I will forever be grateful for everything I learned during this time, but with that being said, I personally didn't feel prepared enough to actually pursue a career. As a result, I started looking into resources that could help me accomplish what I wanted to do: become a competitive tech applicant amongst today's ever-growing applicant pool. After researching many programs, I finally found <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" >Flatiron School</a>.  Flatiron offered a range of programs, from Cybersecurity to UI/UX design, but the one that caught my eye was Software Engineering; claiming to get students ready in 15 weeks, it almost sounded too good to be true! However, after going through the application process, interviewing with the staff, and completing the required preparatory course, I was shocked at the amount of progress I'd made within the span of only a month, culminating in this very website! Consequently, I plan on graduating from this program, and upon completion, I hope to be armed with the skills and connections I need to start the next stage of my professional life.</p>
